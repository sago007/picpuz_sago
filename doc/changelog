  build or install on older Linux distros lacking these libraries.
+ RPM packages are built using Fedora and rpmbuild instead of alien.

2012.01.04  v.2.4
+ An image file can be dragged over from Nautilus or other file manager.

2011.11.01  v.2.3

2011.05.01  v.2.2
+ The supplied .deb and .rpm packages are now built using Ubuntu 10.04
