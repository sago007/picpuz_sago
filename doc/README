Installation of picpuz from source tarball
  
Building picpuz requires the following packages:
   g++                the Gnu C++ compiler and linker 
   libgtk3.0-dev      GTK graphics library (GUI base)

Build and install picpuz as follows:
   1. Download the tar file (picpuz-N.N.tar.gz) to Desktop 
   2. Open a terminal window 
   3. $ cd Desktop                      # go to Desktop 
   4. $ tar -xzf picpuz-N.N.tar.gz      # unpack to ./picpuz 
   5. $ cd picpuz                       # go there 
   6. $ make                            # build program 
   7. $ sudo make install               # install program
  
Missing dependencies will cause error messages in step 6. 
Install these from your repository and repeat step 6. 
 
Step 7 moves all files to the following locations:
   /usr/bin/picpuz             binary executable 
   /usr/share/picpuz/          icons, translations ... 
   /usr/share/doc/picpuz/      user guide, README ... 

Please review the user guide (Help menu) before trying picpuz.

NOTES FOR PACKAGE BUILDERS:
If $PREFIX is defined, files go there instead of /usr. 
If $DESTDIR is also defined, files go to $DESTDIR$PREFIX.
